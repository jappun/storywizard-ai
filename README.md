# storywizard-ai
(WIP) AI-powered story builder to teach primary students about plot structure. 

The goal of Story Wizard is to teach students about basic plot structure an intuitive way. Instead of introducing literary terms up front, the app asks simple, familiar questions to guide students in brainstorming story details. Only after they’ve provided their responses are terms like “setting” or “rising action” used. By generating a complete story using their ideas, I hope Story Wizard also helps students see how each element fits into a story.

There's lots more to do, but you can check out a [demo video](https://youtu.be/Wy45LchiQUs) of the current version.
